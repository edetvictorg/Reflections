Question: 1. How did viewing the diff between two versions of a file help you spot the bug?

Answer: 1. The process of comparing files help to find and fix the error without having to start all over again for the whole project
2. It saved a great deal of time taking us to the location around the bug.

And now, I  just branched out to explore the world

Thank you!
